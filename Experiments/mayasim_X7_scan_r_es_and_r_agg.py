"""Experiment to test the correction of calculation of income from
agriculture and ecosystem services.

This experiment tests the influence of prefactors in income
calculation (r_bca and r_es) for two scenarios:
1) for income calculated as **mean** over income from cells
2) for income calculated as **sum** over income from cells

Explanation
-----------

Previously, the income from aggriculture and ecosystem services for each city
was calculated as the mean of the income from cells which it had under its
controll.

This does not make sense, since the actual harvest is not the mean of the
harvest of different places, but obviously the sum of the harvest from
different places.

Therefore, I changed the calculation of these sources of income to calculate
the sum over different cells.

Then, to get reasonable results, one has to adjust the prefactors in the
calculation of total income, since they have been tailored to reproduce
stylized facts before (and therefore must be taylored to do so again, just
differently)
